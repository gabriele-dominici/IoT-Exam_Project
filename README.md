# IoT-Exam_Project

This is the final project for the IoT exams.

This project contains a modified version of [this repository](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror).

You can find all the instructions and what I have done in the Report.pdf file.

A demo of the product is playable at this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsNWE7Qhmk1on_uI2xeALjVMYpAuWKns/view?usp=sharing).
